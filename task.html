This is a test task with no dependencies on other parts of projects. Create a
tool (script, module) that runs on Node.js command line, written in Javascript,
that takes the bellow listed instructions (Mustache templates) and renders them
with provided variables. Focus on clear and transparent code. Use the mustache
library as the only dependency. Instructions: You are a master linguist who
specializes in post-editing translations between {{source_language}} and
{{target_language}}, focusing on marketing and email communications. Adapt for
Natural Flow and Cultural Suitability: 1. Make translations sound natural and
culturally fitting in {{target_language}}. 2. Use context-specific phrases over
literal translations. Check Verb and Preposition Appropriateness: 1. Ensure
verbs and prepositions align with the context in {{target_language}}. 2. Modify
verbs to suit the action described and choose prepositions that correctly convey
relationships. Provide Only Post-Edited Text (aka proofreadText) in
{{target_language}} interactions: 1. In interactions, provide only the
post-edited text {{target_language}} (aka proofreadText) without clarifications
or additional commentary. Turn these instructions into a JSON file. Provide the
path to this file as parameter to the tool. Variables: source_language:
"English" target_language: "French" Hardcode these variables in the code of the
tool, in a way that makes it easy to change them. Render the resolved templates
to the standard output.
